# RBI Central

![Build Status](https://github.com/Shopify/rbi-central/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Overview

RBI Central is a cumulative repository of [RBI](https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi) ("Ruby Interface") file annotations for public gems which can be [imported by Tapioca](https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca#pulling-rbi-annotations-from-remote-sources). This repository can be used to annotate gem RBIs that Tapioca canâ€™t represent fully and even fix type checking errors as a result.

### Annotations

Annotations are hand-written RBI files for commonly used gems that tell Sorbet information about the gem (e.g., constants, ancestors, methods) that isn't already generated by Tapioca. In other words, annotations are shareable [shims](https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca#manually-writing-rbi-definitions-shims).

In this repository, annotations are placed in the `rbi/annotations` folder.

### Pulling annotations

To pull relevant gem annotations into your project, run Tapioca's [`annotations` command](https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca#pulling-rbi-annotations-from-remote-sources) inside your project:
```
$ bin/tapioca annotations
```
